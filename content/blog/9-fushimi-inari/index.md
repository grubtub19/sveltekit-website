Fushimi Inari is this like hill thing with 10,000 torii gates. There's a cute lil path around the top of it that maybe the most beautiful experience in the world if it wasn't for the 10 billion other people walking it too.

This shit's paradise for a girl with a camera. I got there early and I still had to wait up to like 10 minutes for some of these shots.

Yeah that's pretty much all I did today was take and edit photos, but it was a lot of fun! It's so nice to have the time to do fun things I want to do without a worry in the world :) They should let me do this all the time forever.
