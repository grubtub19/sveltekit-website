I took a non-stop flight from EWR >> HND on Friday.

I thugged it raw no data plan on my train ride to a quaint lil Airbnb in Misuji, Taito City. And holy shit, the train operators in Japan would get ★★★★★ on 電車でGO!

On my arrival, I was greeted by the warm embrace of my bestie and roomfie Vivi aka SleepyJirachi. She had flown in with her beautiful girl wife Lily days prior, and were staying with their friend Cardia from Saudi Arabia in the Airbnb.
Since Lily had an upset stomach, Vivi, Cardia and I got dinner at a Ramen place a 5 minute walk from us. It was mid af.

We went on a grocery run too.

That night, I dreamed that I was walking the streets of Shibuya, but the dream didn't end when I woke up. I'm still here :)
