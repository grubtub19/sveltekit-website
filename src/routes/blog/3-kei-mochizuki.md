When I lived in Tokyo, I had the opportunity to see solo exhibitions from artists that I had followed for years. It was a lot easier then because these events only get announced at most a month ahead of time, so it's *really* lucky that my literal top two favorite artists are both having exhibitions in Tokyo at the same time: Kei Mochizuki (https://twitter.com/key_999) and Yoneyama Mai (https://twitter.com/yoneyamai).

Today was the last day of the Kei Mochizuki exhibition. And sure, I had the norovirus but I would rather shit my pants than miss this. The exhibition was hosted out of Parco Factory in Ikebukuro.

The gallery was so beautiful, I could stop smiling the whole way through. Halfway in, the artist left this message:

Her words resonated with me; I couldn't help but cry. I often conceptualize my life through the lense of the artistic and aesthetic. I believe the meaning of my life is to create: to carve out of reality something uniquely me. So to read these words from an artist I draw so much personal aesthetic inspiration from? It means more to me than my poor creative writing skills could ever describe :p
