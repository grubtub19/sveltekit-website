Today, we had a reservation at the Final Fantasy cafe in Akihabara, so we spent the whole day in the area. I've been looking forward to see how the place has changed since I was last here. I was such a weeb when I studied abroad here, so I knew all the good places. I took everyone to e-Earphones to find a replacement to my Moondrop Arias. I was unfortunately overwhelmed by all the options and how busy the place is but here's some cute shitty bluetooth speakers I found:

The Final Fantasy cafe was delicious and super pretty. My favorite part was all the drinks. Lily knows EVERYTHING about FF, so it explained how all the dishes and drinks connect to the lore. I had so much fun!

After we left, Lily was tired and headed back early, so the three of us explored Akihabara together. I had to check if the Akiba CO Gallery was doing an exhibition and HOLY SHIT I could not have come on a better day!! It was the opening day of the Racing Miku exhibit where they revealed the new 2026 design. When I lived here, I was lucky enough to see the 10th anniversary exhibit, so this one was underwealming relatively. Fortunately, I got to buy a bunch of 2025 Miku merch which is one of my favorite designs from one of my favorite artists Kei Mochizuki (https://twitter.com/key_999). At the event, they revealed a new figurine for 2025 Miku and I fell in love with it instantly. I will buy this at ALL COSTS!!!

The concept of Racing Miku is so cool. I love it when they throw money at artists to do cool things!

The rest of the day we scoured Akihabara for all my favorite shops: BEEP Akihabara, Super Potato, Akibaoh 3rd Shop, Mandrake... It felt so overwealming trying to find what I want, so next time I'll come back with a shopping list :p

Such a fun day! I was so exhausted when I got home :)
