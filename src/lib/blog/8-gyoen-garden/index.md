Left my hotel before noon (finally) and made my way to the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden. Today was the first day using my new FujiFilm camera and finally use all the camera knowledge I've been frantically learning to the test. I think I got some good ones!

Any normal person would have gone to the main palace, but I wanted to do the tour of the Omiya and Sento Imperial Palaces instead. Last time they ran out of entry tickets, so I was happy to get to see it!


I took a quick lunch at Havana for an acai bowl and to process all my photos
